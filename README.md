## Overview of Projects
---


### 1: Use CloudFormation to Launch an Amazon EC2 Web Server  
*Folder: `Level 2 - cloudformation-ec2`*  
Learn the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by writing a CloudFormation template (in JSON or YAML) to deploy an EC2 web server. This project simplifies resource provisioning and promotes best practices for scalable deployments.

---

### 2: How to Deploy a Secure Serverless Static Website on AWS: S3, CloudFront, Route 53 & ACM 
*Folder: `Level 1 - static-website-s3`*  
Build a cost-effective static website by leveraging Amazon S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and AWS Certificate Manager. This beginner-friendly project introduces you to core AWS services while hosting your website globally.

---

### 3: Add a CI/CD Pipeline to an Amazon S3 Bucket  
*Folder: `Level 3 - ci-cd-s3`*  
Automate your deployment workflow with a CI/CD pipeline that integrates with your S3-hosted static website. This project introduces AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeStar to streamline your code delivery process.

---

### 4: Deploy a Simple React Web Application using AWS Amplify  
*Folder: `Level 4 - react-amplify`*  
Experience full-stack development on AWS by deploying a React application with AWS Amplify. This project covers user authentication, API integration, and storage solutions with services like Amazon Cognito, DynamoDB, and AppSync, all while keeping the setup straightforward.

---

### 5: Create an Alexa Skill that Provides Study Tips using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB  
*Folder: `Level 5 - alexa-skill-study-tips`*  
Develop an interactive Alexa skill that delivers study tips. This project uses AWS Lambda and DynamoDB to serve dynamic content via voice commands, making it a great introduction to serverless computing and voice-based applications.

---

### 6: Publish Amazon CloudWatch Metrics to a CSV File using AWS Lambda  
*Folder: `Level 6 loudwatch-csv-lambda`*  
Explore AWS Lambda and the AWS CLI by building a solution that exports CloudWatch metrics into a CSV file. This project requires some coding to extract and process metric data, making it a step up in complexity.

---

### 7: Recognize Celebrities using Amazon Rekognition, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3  
*Folder: `Level 7 - celebrity-recognition`*  
Leverage Amazon Rekognition to identify celebrities in images. A Lambda function automatically processes images uploaded to an S3 bucket to recognize celebrities, showcasing AI-driven image analysis on AWS.

---

### 8: Create a Chatbot that Translates Languages using Amazon Translate and Amazon Lex  
*Folder: `Level 8 - chatbot-translate-lex`*  
Combine multiple AWS AI services to build a conversational chatbot that translates languages. This project involves integrating Amazon Translate, Amazon Lex, and AWS Lambda, and presents a more advanced challenge due to its multi-service orchestration.

---

### 9: Host a Dedicated Jenkins Server on Amazon EC2  
*Folder: `Level 9 - jenkins-ec2`*  
Gain hands-on experience with Amazon EC2 by setting up your own Jenkins server. This project offers insight into configuring a secure, scalable CI environment on AWS and requires a deeper understanding of EC2 management, networking, and security.

---

### 10: Train and Deploy a Machine Learning Model using Amazon SageMaker  
*Folder: `Level 10 - sagemaker-ml`*  
Dive into machine learning with Amazon SageMaker. In this most challenging project, you will train a model (using Python and a provided dataset) to predict consumer behavior, gaining valuable experience in ML concepts and data handling.
