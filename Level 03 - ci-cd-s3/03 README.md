# CI/CD Pipeline for a Static Website on Amazon S3

## Overview + Setup

### Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up an automated CI/CD pipeline on AWS that deploys updates to a static website hosted on Amazon S3. The pipeline is triggered by changes in your GitHub repository, builds your site if needed, and then deploys the latest version to your S3 bucket.

Modern software delivery requires continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to accelerate development and improve reliability. In this project, you'll create a pipeline that automatically deploys website changes:
- **Source Stage:** Pulls updated website code from GitHub.
- **Build Stage (Optional):** Builds or processes your website files (using AWS CodeBuild if required).
- **Deploy Stage:** Deploys the site to an Amazon S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.

### Services Used
- **Amazon S3:** Hosts the static website.
- **AWS CodePipeline:** Orchestrates the end-to-end CI/CD process.
- **AWS CodeBuild:** (Optional) Builds your application assets.
- **AWS CodeStar:** (Optional) Provides an integrated interface for project management.
- **GitHub:** Acts as the source repository for your website code.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
1. An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
2. An S3 bucket set up for static website hosting.
3. A GitHub repository containing your static website code.
4. AWS CLI installed and configured (if you wish to use the CLI).
5. (Optional) A `buildspec.yml` file in your repository if you need to build your site.

### Pipeline Architecture
1. **Source Stage:** CodePipeline monitors your GitHub repository for changes.
2. **Build Stage (Optional):** If your website requires a build step (e.g., a React or Angular app), AWS CodeBuild runs the necessary commands.  
   _Example `buildspec.yml`:_
   ```yaml
   version: 0.2

   phases:
     build:
       commands:
         - echo "Installing dependencies..."
         - npm install
         - echo "Building static assets..."
         - npm run build
   artifacts:
     files:
       - 'build/**/*'
   ```
3. **Deploy Stage:** CodePipeline deploys the updated website files to your Amazon S3 bucket. Be sure to enable the **Extract file before deploy** option if your source artifact is zipped.

### Setup Instructions
#### 1. Prepare Your Static Website
- Create or update your static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Push your code to a GitHub repository.
- (Optional) Add a `buildspec.yml` file if a build process is needed.

#### 2. Configure Your Amazon S3 Bucket
- Create an S3 bucket and enable static website hosting.
- Update the bucket policy to allow public read access (if required).

#### 3. Create Your CI/CD Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline
1. **Log into the AWS Management Console** and open AWS CodePipeline.
2. **Create a new pipeline:**
   - **Pipeline Name:** e.g., `StaticWebsiteCICDPipeline`
   - **Service Role:** Either create a new role or use an existing one with necessary permissions.
3. **Add Source Stage:**
   - **Source Provider:** GitHub.
   - **Repository:** Connect to your GitHub repository.
   - **Branch:** Choose the branch to monitor.
4. **Add Build Stage (Optional):**
   - If your project requires building, add an AWS CodeBuild action.
   - Otherwise, skip this stage.
5. **Add Deploy Stage:**
   - **Deploy Provider:** Amazon S3.
   - **Bucket:** Specify your S3 bucket for hosting.
   - **Extract file before deploy:** Enable this if the source artifact is a zip file.
6. **Review and Create:** Once configured, create the pipeline.
7. **Test the Pipeline:** Push a change to your GitHub repository and verify that the pipeline runs and your website updates automatically.

#### 4. (Optional) Integrate AWS CodeStar
- Create a CodeStar project to monitor and manage your CI/CD pipeline.
- CodeStar offers additional dashboards and tools for managing AWS resources and can help simplify permissions and monitoring.

### Testing & Verification
- **Commit a Change:** Update your website code and push it to GitHub.
- **Pipeline Execution:** Monitor AWS CodePipeline for the progress of the build and deploy stages.
- **Website Verification:** Access your website via the S3 endpoint (e.g., `http://your-bucket.s3-website-your-region.amazonaws.com`) to confirm that the latest changes have been deployed.

### Troubleshooting
- **Build Failures:** Check CodeBuild logs if the build stage fails.
- **Deployment Issues:** Verify S3 bucket permissions and that the “Extract file before deploy” option is correctly set.
- **GitHub Connection:** Ensure that your GitHub integration is working and that AWS CodePipeline has the correct permissions to access your repository.
