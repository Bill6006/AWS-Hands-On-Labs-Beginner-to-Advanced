# README Overview: SageMaker with and without Containers  

This Folder provides two guides for setting up an Amazon SageMaker working environment, each catering to different use cases:


## Why Two Approaches?  

1. **SageMaker with Docker & Kubernetes** – This approach is ideal for users who want to containerize their development environment, create reproducible ML workflows, and deploy at scale using Kubernetes.  
2. **SageMaker Without Containers** – This guide focuses on a simpler, AWS-native approach using SageMaker Notebook Instances without the need for containerization or orchestration.  

## Which One Should You Use?  

- Choose the **Docker & Kubernetes** version if you need scalability, flexibility, and a standardized environment across teams.  
- Choose the **No Containers** version if you prefer a straightforward, beginners-friendly, AWS-managed solution for experimentation and development.  

Both approaches ensure a productive SageMaker setup, allowing you to develop, train, and deploy ML models efficiently.
