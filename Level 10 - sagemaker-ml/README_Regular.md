# How to Set Up an Amazon SageMaker Working Environment on AWS

This repository documents the process of creating an Amazon SageMaker working environment using native AWS services. Follow these steps to launch a SageMaker Notebook Instance, configure the environment, and run your machine learning workloads—all without container orchestration.

---

## AWS Services Used

- **Amazon SageMaker** – To develop, train, and deploy machine learning models using Jupyter notebooks.
- **AWS IAM** – To manage secure access and permissions for your SageMaker resources.
- **Amazon S3** – To store data sets, notebooks, and model artifacts (optional, for data storage).

## AWS Architecture Diagram

Below is an overview of the architecture for a SageMaker working environment:

- A SageMaker Notebook Instance serves as your interactive development environment.
- The instance accesses data stored in Amazon S3 and leverages AWS IAM for secure operations.
- Trained models can be deployed using SageMaker endpoints for real-time inference.

> **Note:** Replace the diagram below with your custom architecture image if needed.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Your Amazon SageMaker Environment

1. **Access the SageMaker Console:**
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to **Amazon SageMaker**.

2. **Create a Notebook Instance:**
   - In the SageMaker console, select **Notebook instances** and click **Create notebook instance**.
   - Choose an instance name (e.g., `my-sagemaker-notebook`) and select an appropriate instance type (e.g., `ml.t2.medium` for small workloads).
   - Configure additional settings such as VPC, if needed.

3. **Assign an IAM Role:**
   - Create or select an existing IAM role that grants SageMaker the necessary permissions (e.g., access to Amazon S3 and CloudWatch).
   - Ensure the role has policies attached for SageMaker operations and any other resources you plan to use.

4. **Launch the Instance:**
   - Click **Create notebook instance**.
   - Wait for the instance status to become **InService**.
   - Once active, click **Open Jupyter** to access your notebook environment.

### Step 2: Configure Your Notebook Environment

1. **Customize Your Environment:**
   - Within the Jupyter Notebook, install any additional libraries needed for your ML projects (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).
   - Use terminal commands or notebook cells, for example:
     ```bash
     !pip install tensorflow scikit-learn
     ```

2. **Set Up Data Access:**
   - If your project requires data stored in Amazon S3, use the AWS SDK (Boto3) to access the data directly from your notebooks.
   - Example snippet:
     ```python
     import boto3
     s3 = boto3.client('s3')
     response = s3.list_buckets()
     print('Existing buckets:', response['Buckets'])
     ```

3. **Leverage Lifecycle Configurations (Optional):**
   - Configure lifecycle scripts to automate environment setup tasks (e.g., installing libraries or setting environment variables) every time the notebook instance starts.

### Step 3: Run and Monitor Training Jobs

1. **Develop Your Machine Learning Code:**
   - Create and test your model training code within your notebook.
   - Use SageMaker’s built-in estimators to launch training jobs on managed infrastructure.

2. **Submit a Training Job:**
   - Use the SageMaker Python SDK to define and submit a training job:
     ```python
     import sagemaker
     from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow

     estimator = TensorFlow(entry_point='train.py',
                            role='<your-iam-role>',
                            instance_count=1,
                            instance_type='ml.m5.large',
                            framework_version='2.3.0',
                            py_version='py37')
     estimator.fit({'training': 's3://your-bucket/path/to/training-data'})
     ```

3. **Monitor the Job:**
   - Track the training job’s progress through the SageMaker console or programmatically.
   - Use Amazon CloudWatch for logging and monitoring the performance of your jobs.

---

### Step 4: Deploy Models and Create Endpoints (Optional)

1. **Deploy a Trained Model:**
   - Once training is complete, deploy your model as a SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference:
     ```python
     predictor = estimator.deploy(initial_instance_count=1,
                                  instance_type='ml.m5.xlarge')
     ```

2. **Test the Endpoint:**
   - Send test data to the endpoint to verify its performance:
     ```python
     response = predictor.predict(data)
     print(response)
     ```

3. **Manage Endpoint Lifecycle:**
   - Use the SageMaker console to monitor, update, or delete endpoints as needed.

## Additional Enhancements

- **Data Storage & Management:**  
  - Integrate Amazon S3 for scalable data storage and retrieval.
- **Security Best Practices:**  
  - Regularly update IAM policies and restrict permissions to only those needed.
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Leverage SageMaker features like automatic model tuning and distributed training for larger datasets.
- **Cost Management:**  
  - Monitor usage and set up alerts to manage AWS costs effectively.

## Estimated Project Costs

- **Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance:**  
  - Costs depend on instance type and usage. For example, an `ml.t2.medium` instance may cost a few dollars per day.
  
- **Training Jobs & Endpoints:**  
  - Charged based on compute time and instance type. Monitor usage to estimate monthly costs.
  
- **Amazon S3 Storage:**  
  - Minimal costs for small datasets; scale as needed.
