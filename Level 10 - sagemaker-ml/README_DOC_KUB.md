# How to Set Up an Amazon SageMaker Working Environment with Docker & Kubernetes

This repository documents the process of creating an Amazon SageMaker working environment, containerizing your custom applications with Docker, and deploying them on a Kubernetes cluster. This guide blends AWS’s SageMaker setup with container orchestration techniques, enabling scalable, production-grade machine learning workflows.

---

## AWS & Container Services Used

- **Amazon SageMaker** – For interactive Jupyter notebooks, model training, and hosting endpoints.
- **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** – To store and manage your Docker images.
- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** – To deploy and manage your containerized applications.
- **Docker** – To containerize your development environment and ML applications.
- **AWS IAM** – To manage secure access and permissions for AWS resources.

---

## Architecture Diagram

Below is an overview of the architecture:

- A SageMaker Notebook Instance is used to develop and test ML models.
- A custom Docker image is built (using a Dockerfile) that replicates your working environment.
- The Docker image is pushed to Amazon ECR.
- A Kubernetes cluster (EKS or local using minikube) pulls the image from ECR and deploys it as one or more pods.
- SageMaker training jobs or inference endpoints can be launched based on these container images.

> **Note:** The diagram below is a placeholder. Replace it with your custom architecture image if needed.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Set Up the Amazon SageMaker Environment

1. **Follow the AWS SageMaker Guide:**  
   - Open the [AWS SageMaker setup guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.html).
   - Create a SageMaker notebook instance and configure the environment with the necessary libraries.
   - Launch your notebook and run sample notebooks to confirm that SageMaker is correctly set up.
   > **Tip:** Customize your instance with lifecycle configurations if you plan to run additional scripts on startup.

2. **Test Your Environment:**  
   - Run a sample notebook to ensure you can access data and execute training jobs.
   - Validate that your IAM roles are correctly configured to allow SageMaker operations.

---

### Step 2: Containerize the Environment with Docker

1. **Create a Dockerfile:**  
   - In your project directory, create a `Dockerfile` that installs the required libraries (Python, Jupyter, ML frameworks, etc.) mirroring your SageMaker instance.
   - Example snippet:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM python:3.9-slim
     RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
         pip install boto3 sagemaker numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY . /app
     CMD ["jupyter", "notebook", "--ip=0.0.0.0", "--port=8888", "--allow-root"]
     ```
   > **Note:** Adjust the Dockerfile according to your project’s dependencies.

2. **Build and Test the Docker Image:**  
   - Build your Docker image locally:
     ```bash
     docker build -t sagemaker-custom-env .
     ```
   - Run the container to test:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 8888:8888 sagemaker-custom-env
     ```
   - Access Jupyter Notebook via `http://localhost:8888` to verify everything is working.

---

### Step 3: Push Your Docker Image to Amazon ECR

1. **Create an ECR Repository:**  
   - Open the Amazon ECR console and create a new repository (e.g., `sagemaker-custom-env`).
2. **Authenticate and Push:**  
   - Authenticate your Docker client to your ECR registry:
     ```bash
     aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
     ```
   - Tag your image:
     ```bash
     docker tag sagemaker-custom-env:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-custom-env:latest
     ```
   - Push the image:
     ```bash
     docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-custom-env:latest
     ```

---

### Step 4: Deploy on Kubernetes

1. **Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster:**  
   - **Option A:** Create an Amazon EKS cluster using the AWS Management Console or eksctl.
   - **Option B:** For local testing, use Minikube.
   > **Note:** Ensure your Kubernetes cluster can access your ECR repository (via IAM roles or by configuring Kubernetes secrets).

2. **Create Deployment Manifests:**  
   - Create a Kubernetes deployment YAML file (`deployment.yaml`):
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: sagemaker-env-deployment
     spec:
       replicas: 2
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: sagemaker-env
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: sagemaker-env
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: sagemaker-container
             image: <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-custom-env:latest
             ports:
             - containerPort: 8888
     ```
   - Create a corresponding service (`service.yaml`) to expose your deployment:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: sagemaker-env-service
     spec:
       type: LoadBalancer
       ports:
       - port: 80
         targetPort: 8888
       selector:
         app: sagemaker-env
     ```

3. **Deploy to the Cluster:**  
   - Apply the manifests:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     kubectl apply -f service.yaml
     ```
   - Monitor your pods and service:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     kubectl get service sagemaker-env-service
     ```

---

### Step 5: Integrate SageMaker with Your Containerized Environment

1. **Custom Training Jobs:**  
   - Leverage SageMaker’s capability to run training jobs from custom Docker images by specifying your ECR image in the training job configuration.
   - Update your training script to reference the Docker image hosted in ECR.
2. **Endpoint Deployment:**  
   - Once your model is trained, deploy it as a SageMaker endpoint using your custom image. This offers a seamless transition between your development (Docker/Kubernetes) and production environments.

---

### Step 6: Test and Monitor Your Deployment

1. **Access the Service:**  
   - Navigate to the load balancer’s DNS (provided by the Kubernetes service) to access the running Jupyter Notebook or your custom application.
2. **Verify Logs & Metrics:**  
   - Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to check container logs.
   - Leverage AWS CloudWatch (for SageMaker) and Kubernetes dashboards (for EKS or Minikube) to monitor performance and scale as needed.

---

## Additional Enhancements

- **Auto Scaling & Rollouts:**  
  - Configure Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to manage traffic load dynamically.
- **Security Best Practices:**  
  - Use IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) with EKS to secure access to AWS resources.
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  - Integrate your Docker build and Kubernetes deployment into a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, or similar tools.
- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  - Enable detailed logging using CloudWatch for SageMaker and Kubernetes monitoring solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for container performance.

---

## Estimated Project Costs

- **Amazon SageMaker:**  
  - Charges depend on the instance type and usage time for notebook instances and training jobs.
- **Amazon ECR:**  
  - Storage and data transfer fees are minimal for small images.
- **Amazon EKS:**  
  - EKS clusters incur a fixed hourly fee plus costs for the worker nodes.
- **Kubernetes (Minikube):**  
  - No direct cost for local testing, though compute resources are used.

> **Note:** Always review AWS pricing pages for the latest cost details.
